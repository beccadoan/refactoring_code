Horiseon Style Solutions Web Page

I inherited this project from Horiseon Style Solutions to refactor the code to make it more readable.
Previously, this web page functioned the same, but the code was not easy to read.
I have added semantic HTML elements in places that used to be divs, and added more accessibility through alt attributes.
This is also helping the website with search engine optimization.
I was also able to clean up CSS by bringing multiple classes together that shared the same styling
